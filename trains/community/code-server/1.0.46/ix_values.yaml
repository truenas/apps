  notes: |
    In order to install additional packages in the code-server container,
    you need to shell into the container as root. You can do this by running the following command:

    ```sh
    docker exec -it --user root <container_name> /bin/bash
    ```

    Note that packages installed will be lost when the container is updated or re-created.
