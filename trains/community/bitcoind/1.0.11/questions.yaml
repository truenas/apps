            pruned and 'Block Filter Index' is off, enabling it will prevent your node from
            starting. To fix this while keeping 'Block Filter Index' on, you will need to either
            reindex your node or turn off 'Prune Old Blocks'.

            your node doesn't waste resources on unresponsive ones. A shorter timeout value allows

            stable connections with responsive peers while avoiding unresponsive ones. A shorter
            timeout value leads to faster disconnection from unresponsive peers, while a longer
            timeout allows more time for slow-responding peers to complete the handshake.

            limit. By adjusting it, you can optimize your node's bandwidth usage and maintain a
            balance between sharing data with the network and conserving your internet resources.
            A higher upload target allows your node to contribute more data to the network, while a
            lower target helps you save bandwidth for other uses.

            optimize your node's performance and balance memory usage based on your device's

            keep your mempool up-to-date and reduces memory usage, while a longer expiry time allows

            larger limit allows your node to store more orphan transactions, potentially increasing
            the chances of finding missing inputs. A smaller limit conserves memory but will result
            in your node evicting some orphan transactions from memory when the limit is reached.
