# Asigra DS-System

[Asigra DS-System](https://hub.docker.com/r/asigra/ds-system) - DS-System software enables you to offer a robust, scalable service to multiple customers.

Ease of use comes from the agentless architecture: customers only need to install the DS-Client on one LAN computer,
thereby eliminating the need to install software on each target backup / restore computer.
As long as the DS-Client is networked with the target backup / restore computers, you will be able to browse data,
back it up, and restore it as required. Customers can take advantage of automatic and unattended backups for data
environments ranging from single-user standalone computers up to enterprise-wide LANs and WANs. During backups,
the DS-Client extracts changed data, compresses, and encrypts the items specified for backup. Only new or modified data is backed up,
thereby accelerating the backup transmission time. The backup data is sent via the Internet, Intranet, or direct dial-up to the secure,
off-site Data Center that hosts the DS-System Vault. Restores are performed on demand, via the same DS-Client, once the DS-Client's
security measures have been cleared.
