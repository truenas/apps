# Forgejo

[Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) is a self-hosted lightweight software forge.

On initial startup a setup wizard will be launched with settings for `database`, `ports`, `path`, and `domain` prefilled.
Keep them as they are, fill anything you want in the optional settings section and click on `Install Forgejo`.
