# Hoppscotch

[Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io) is a lightweight, web-based API development
suite. [Github](https://github.com/hoppscotch/hoppscotch)

## Notes for devs
`compose-split.yaml` and `my.env` was the config I used initially to get
hoppscotch running at all locally and to have a base reference for creating
`templates/docker-compose.yaml`.
