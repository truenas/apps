# NocoDB

NocoDB is an open source NoCode platform that turns any database into a smart spreadsheet. It can be thought of as an Airtable or Smartsheet alternative.

NocoDB works by connecting to any relational database and transforming them into a smart spreadsheet interface! This allows you to build no-code applications collaboratively with teams. NocoDB currently works with MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, Amazon Aurora & MariaDB databases.
