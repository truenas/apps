    Globalping Probe is now running and connecting to the Globalping network.

    ## Important Information

    - If you provided an adoption token, your probe will be automatically adopted to your account
    - Check your probe status and logs at: https://dash.globalping.io
    - **Note:** Probe runs as non-root (uid 1000) with NET_RAW capability for ICMP tests to work properly
    - A new probe UUID is generated on each restart (no persistent storage).
    - As long as your public IP does not change when the probe is not running, the API will still correctly identify it as the same probe

    ## Limitations (from Globalping)

    - Only one probe can run per IP address
    - Probes connecting through anonymous proxies, Tor, or VPN services will be blocked
    - If a probe's location is not accurate you can change it in our dashboard
