  notes_body: |
    For additional configuration you can either use the WebUI,
    or add them in the [additional_config] section.

    See [available options](https://github.com/transmission/transmission/blob/main/docs/Editing-Configuration-Files.md#options).
    Anything set on the [additional_config] section will be added/updated to the `settings.json`
    and changing it's value from the WebUI will be reset on the next deployment.
