    For additional configuration you can either use the WebUI,
    or add them in the [additional_config] section.

    See [this default JSON](https://github.com/truenas/charts/blob/master/charts/transmission/values.yaml)
    for available options. Anything set on the [additional_config] section will be added to the JSON.
    and changing it's value from the WebUI will be reset on the next deployment.
